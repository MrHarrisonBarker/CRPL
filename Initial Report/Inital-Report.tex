\chapter{Introduction}

CRPL or \textbf{C}opy\textbf{r}ight on a \textbf{p}ublic \textbf{l}edger is an open platform for registering and managing the copyrights of a creators intellectual property secured on the publicly distributed ledger Ethereum. The immutability and public distribution of a blockchain is the essential component to the success of this platform and allows copyright registration to be placed in everyones hands.

The blockchain industry is currently booming with thousands of startups and big name players getting involved innovating with this new technology, however I believe there is a big misstep in the application of blockchain technology as generally the systems and product being made are using its as a marketing pitch not a fundamentally different way of creating a system. Most are web apps we already have but with blockchain internals whereas the application of blockchain within social and democratic issues is immense (Don and Alex Tapscott talk about this topic in more depth in their book Blockchain Revolution\cite{blockchain_revolution} which in part inspired me to develop this particular project) and should be the real focus of this new technology.

The core motivation for this project is two fold: first is the simplification or disintermediation of intellectual property rights and secondly is the decentralisation of copyright. The idea of copyright is simple however the implementation is far from, a large part of this comes from the fact that copyright existed before the internet meaning governments had to each implement their own idea of copyright this became a real problem when intellectual property went global thanks to the internet. Now each system has to sort of mesh with each others which can be extremely complex especially when it comes to smaller independent creators.

I believe my solution will solve a lot of these issues by making the protection of intellectual property easy and open.

%TODO user feedback (supervisor)

\chapter{Analysis}
%TODO has everything done so far backed up what was originally planned

\chapter{Conclusion}
%TODO main takeaways so far

\chapter{Progress and the future}
%TODO what have i done so far (prototype, task backlog, design feedback), what needs to get done for the project to be finished
