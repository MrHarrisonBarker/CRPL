\section{Introduction}
% TODO The problem. Take inspiration from the presentation

The aim of this project is to represent a version of \keyword{copyright} for protection of intellectual property on a \keyword{blockchain} backed by a public ledger of transactions. My initial impetus for this project was a book I read in 2018 called \textit{"Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World"}\cite{blockchain_revolution}, before this point I knew little of the applications for blockchain technologies attributing them only to a new form of digital currency allowing peer to peer transactions of wealth.

However, this book introduced the concept of \keyword{smart contracts} and the possibilities now small immutable programs could be saved and run on a blockchain. The most relevant change smart contracts brought was progressive state into an infamously immutable technology, by leveraging an unmodifiable chain of transactions state became not just a current record (like most traditional systems) but a historical account of all previous states with a clear a definable list of transformations precisely timestamped.

This new knowledge of \keyword{blockchains} came to fruition when it came to selecting my final project but to what problem should I help to provide a solution to leveraging this technology. A combination of recent interest in the crypto-sphere mainly coming from NFTs, continued displays of a \keyword{copyright} system not fit for purpose\cite{DMCA-abuse} and the book I had read 3 years earlier proposing that \keyword{blockchain} and \keyword{smart contracts} were an extremely viable solution to problems intersecting law and social structures.

\subsection{Unfit for purpose}

% general complexity
% complexity from different countries laws
% digital world is global so should copyright
% computerised and open

Focusing on the problem at hand being the current copyright system is not fit for its purpose. 

\subsection{What a solution needs}

% TODO what is needed of a solution to fix this problem?

\section{Research}
\subsection{Blockchain}
% TODO Technical knowledge needed to implement
% TODO How it works?
% TODO Why use it?

\subsection{Existing solutions}

\subsubsection{Copyright law}
% TODO The state of the current copyright system
\subsubsection{Online rights management}
% TODO How do creators manage protection of their work

\subsection{Development theory}
% TODO Explanation of agile development methodology
% TODO TDD and Scrum

\subsection{Aims of the solution}
% TODO The over arcing aims of the solution, aka what should the system fix

\section{Design}

\subsection{Technical Requirements}
% TODO a more comprehensive and detailed list of requirements

\begin{description}
	\item[Copyright smart contract] Immutable code on a public ledger “blockchain“ for the purpose of establishing ownership or the copyright to a piece of work.
	\item[Multi-party distribution] The ability to establish a complex ownership structure which includes multiple individuals/groups.
	\item[Ownership transfer] The ability to change the ownership of a copyright from one complex structure to another with consent of all current owner(s).
	\item[Work verification] Verification of a work to establish its originality with a reasonable accuracy for the platform.
	\item[Dispute filing] Allow any user to dispute a copyright with sufficient evidence and provide an option for resolving these disputes by the owner(s).
	\item[Digital signing] Digital signing a work for authentic verification based on our records.
	\item[\color{orange}{Decentralised Work CDN & proxy}] Providing an access point for stored work within the chain.
	\item[\color{orange}{Web-socket updates}] Real-time updates for the front-end UI to provide a better end-user experience.
